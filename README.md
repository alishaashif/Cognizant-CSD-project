Daily sales report is the core-tracking element for controlling cash, sales performance and forecasting the future sales. The purpose of the daily sales report is to be informed about the level of activity taking place within the sales organization and to make sure that the organization is achieving the sales target as planned. 
Here we are extracting the sales report of the supermarket which has 3 branches in 3 cities. After cleaning and pre-processing the data, it is analysed  to provide the level of activities taking place in the supermarket.
